# DESIGN SPECIFICATION: QROYAL - Enterprise Loyalty Infrastructure

## Brand Identity & Aesthetic
**Core Concept:** "Royal-Grade B2B Loyalty." The design must bridge the gap between high-end luxury and functional enterprise software. It should feel like a premium banking app combined with a modern lifestyle platform.
**Visual Style:** 
- **Minimalism:** Use high white space to create a sense of breathability and clarity.
- **Glassmorphism:** Sublte backdrop-blurs on sticky headers and modals.
- **Elevation:** Layered components with soft, large-radius shadows (e.g., shadow-2xl with low opacity).
- **Rounding:** Extreme corner radii (rounded-[2.5rem] for cards, rounded-2xl for buttons) to create a friendly yet modern tech feel.

## Color Palette
- **Primary Blue:** #135bec (Deep, energetic blue for trust and action).
- **Accent Gold:** #C5A059 (Used for rewards, achievements, and premium highlights).
- **Surface:** #f6f6f8 (Light mode background), #ffffff (Card background).
- **Dark Mode:** #101622 (Deep navy-black for high-contrast professional environments).

## Typography
- **Headers:** Manrope/Inter, font-weight 800-900. Bold, tight tracking (-0.05em) for an impactful, authoritative look.
- **Body:** Inter, font-weight 400-600. Clean, highly legible.
- **Micro-copy:** All-caps with high letter-spacing (0.2em-0.3em) for section labels and metadata.

## Page-Specific Design Guidelines

### 1. Customer Home (The Mobile Wallet)
- **Header:** Large personalized greeting ("Good morning, John.") in black, contrast with a tiny uppercase date label.
- **The "Crown" Card:** The top loyalty card should be a hero element. Use a clean progress bar (2px height) that fills with solid black or gold. 
- **Universal QR FAB:** A floating, circular button at the bottom center. Black background with a white QR icon.
- **Navigation:** Bottom navigation bar with thin icons and tiny labels. Use active-state scaling (button grows slightly when selected).

### 2. Business Dashboard (Analytics Hub)
- **Layout:** Bento-box style grid. Cards should have different sizes based on data priority.
- **Data Viz:** Line charts for "New Members" using the Primary Blue with a subtle gradient fill underneath.
- **Interaction:** Cards should have a "drag handle" affordance (six-dot icon) in edit mode.
- **Buttons:** 
  - *Primary:* Solid #135bec with a shadow of the same color but lower opacity.
  - *Secondary:* White background, thin border-slate-200, black text.
  - *Kiosk Mode:* Large, prominent icon-only button with a high-contrast background.

### 3. Kiosk/Scanner Interface
- **Mode:** Full-screen immersive UI. Large, high-legibility clock in the center.
- **Feedback:** When a scan is successful, use a full-screen semi-transparent green overlay with an "award" animation (confetti effect).
- **Call to Action:** Two massive side-by-side buttons at the bottom: "Scan Guest" and "Create New Member."

### 4. Content & Profile Editors
- **Form Fields:** Inputs should be `bg-slate-50` with a `border-slate-200`. On focus, the border changes to #135bec with a subtle outer ring (glow).
- **Markdown Editor:** A custom toolbar for text styling (Bold, Italic, Link) that matches the rounded button style of the rest of the app.
- **Image Uploaders:** "Empty" states should use dashed borders and a "plus" icon. Post-upload, show a high-quality preview with a "Change" button overlay.

### 5. Business Profile (Public View)
- **Cover Area:** Full-width high-resolution imagery with a bottom-to-top dark gradient overlay.
- **Logo Placement:** The logo should break the "boundary" between the cover photo and the content area (half-on, half-off).
- **Sticky Tab-nav:** A pill-shaped toggle bar (Posts | Discounts | About) that follows the user as they scroll.

## Interactive Elements & State Design
- **Hover:** All buttons should lift slightly (translate-y-[-2px]) and increase shadow depth.
- **Active (Click):** Scale down to 95% (transform scale-95) for tactile feedback.
- **Loading:** Use a minimalist circular spinner ( Primary Blue) with a soft pulsing background behind it.
- **Success:** Use "Accent Gold" for celebratory moments (rewards, point milestones).

## Imagery Direction
- **Photography:** Use "lifestyle enterprise" imagery. Clean offices, modern coffee shops, high-end retail environments with bright lighting and soft focus backgrounds.
- **Icons:** Material Symbols Outlined, weight 300-400 for a precise, "techy" look.
